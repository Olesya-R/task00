    <h2 id="favorite-superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
        So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being
            could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman
        could be considered a superhero.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest
        story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good
        guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a
        superhero.</p>

    <p>Batgirl</p>
    <p>Batgirl is one of Batman's side-kicks and a member of the Batman Family similar to Robin. There have been several
        women to take the position over the years. The original Batgirl during the Silver Age was Bette Kane. This was later
        removed from continuity, and the character was reintroduced under the alias Flamebird. The most well-recognized
        Batgirl is Barbara Gordon.</p>
