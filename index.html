    <h2 id="favorite-superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
        So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being
            could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman
        could be considered a superhero.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest
        story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good
        guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a
        superhero.</p>
